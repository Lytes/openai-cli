# openai-cli
A tool written in golang that allows access to chat.openai.com from your command line interface. 

## Installation
Compile from source
```
git clone https://github.com/Lytes/openai-cli
cd openai-cli
go build -o openai-cli main.go
```
OR download and use the openai-cli executable (ELF file for Linux Users)


### Setup
A `config.json` file has to be placed in the same directory as the executable. The file contains both `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` (Session Token) and `mixpaneltoken`, both are cookies that should be copied from user browser after logging in. 

Here's an example of the json file
```
{"sessiontoken":"eyJhbGciOiJkaXIi...",
"mixpaneltoken":"%7B%22distinct_id%22%3A%20%22user-..."
}
```
If unfamiliar with getting cookies from your browser, I suggest asking the AI on chat.openai.com

### Usage
Example
```
./openai-cli -prompt "Is it pronounced tomato or tomato"
```
Output
```
